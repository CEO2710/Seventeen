# Unplanned Reoperation Risk Prediction

This project predicts the risk of unplanned reoperation using machine learning models.

## Features
- Five machine learning algorithms: Logistic Regression, XGBoost, LightGBM, Random Forest, and SVM
- SHAP for model interpretability
- Streamlit web interface for predictions

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/unplanned-reoperation-prediction.git
